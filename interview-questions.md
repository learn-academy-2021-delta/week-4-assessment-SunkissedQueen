# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Most parents or guardians share their traits and properties with their children. Well! React carries this sharing and caring mentality my using props to send various properties of the parent class to its children classes or components. Props cannot be manipulated on the children class just displayed.

  Researched answer: Key words and tricky phrases!!! React certainly has some builtin tools to assist a developer. Let's look at props aka properties. `Props` is a keyword that allow properties to be shared between components. Child components normally pass data from the state using this technique. Props are immutable.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: Device Object Model events are the changes made to the state of an object, which can be viewed on the UI. For instance, each letter that I typed on the computer is changing the state and therefore producing an even that can be seen on the screen.

  Researched answer:The webpage is loading. An impatient person is clicking the mouse. The image has finally loaded on the computer screen. Now the irritated person can finally input her user id and password. Yes, a common occurrence in a workspace. Additionally, these are also examples of DOM (Document Object Model) Events. Each event are signals or triggers to state that something is occurring or has occurred. As you can see, they are dependent on the browser or user interactions.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Who's down with OOP? If you are dealing with React, you better be. OOP or object-oriented programming is everything that its name leads you to think and more. You can perform many interactions for the user by setting code block based on manipulating objects and classes. OF course, all great things have to face competition---functional programming. If you are not OOPing, you are functioning your way into a useful webpage.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming uses classes and objects to manipulate data. Four main principles---encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism---help OOP language to establish how the properties of a class or object will be viewed or manipulated. Functional programming has more freedom to be on any other code block not having to be tied to any classes or objects. Functions are used to produce new variables. No time for storage just serving outputs.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: The most compassionate programming language Ruby has a distinction between a float and an integer. That decimal for the float allows you to allow other floats to appear in answers.

  Researched answer: Integer is a whole number, whereas float is a number with a decimal. When you are performing complex calculations or seeking more accuracy in the answer, evaluations with a decimal has to be passed in the code block. For instance, 2.0 or 4.3 are suffice to produce a float in the solution.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: If there is only one line of code to be returned, then implicit return gives flexibility in writing the word `return`. Implicit return will automatically display the last line of executable code with the word `return`.

  Researched answer: Ruby the minimalist! If coding fits on one line, then it is common practice not to use `return`. Ruby will handle that message for you.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: type of variable that starts with an `@` symbol

2. PostgreSQL: open source object-relational database system that help developers build applications

3. Ruby on Rails: programmer friendly web application framework running on the Ruby programming language

4. ORM: Object-relational mapping that allows addressing, accessing, and manipulating objects without changing the code for related applications

5. Active Record: a type of ORM that takes data which is stored in a database table using rows and columns and can be manipulated by writing SQL statements
